# WaterRocket
The Source Code of the water rocket project I made with a ESP8266 on the Arduino IDE.

The ESP8266 uses the BMP280 barometer and the MPU9250 accelerometer.

I used the BMP280 to meassure the pressure, altitude and temperature.
And the MPU9250 to calculate the accelerations to check if the rocket has fired.


The code is has a lot of comments so it should be quite clear.
